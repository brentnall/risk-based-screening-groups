# risk-based-screening-groups

An algorithm to help decide risk groups for risk adapted screening

## Overview 

The main routines are:

- **riskproto.py**: python code to optimise risk groups given constraints in `config.ini`
- **riskproto-iterH.py**: python code to optimise risk groups by looping over different values of the constraint (hard coded)

The `input` folder contains csv files for the scenarios considered in the current paper.

Output is generated in a csv file `output.csv`.
